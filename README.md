# Managerial Insights

1. Focus on improving movie quality and audience appeal: The dashboard shows a declining trend in IMDB ratings over the years, suggesting a need to focus on improving movie quality and audience appeal to maintain or increase ratings.
   
2. Diversify movie genres: The "Distribution of Movie Genres Over Decades" chart indicates an opportunity to diversify movie genres beyond the currently dominant genres like Action/Adventure, Action-Sci-Fi, and Drama/Thriller/War. Exploring other genres could help attract a wider audience.

3. Understand top directors and learn from their success: The "Top Directors by Number of Movies" chart highlights successful directors like Akira Kurosawa, Steven Spielberg, and Stanley Kubrick. Studying their approach and techniques could provide valuable insights for your project.
   
4. Monitor movie performance trends: The "Yearly IMDB Votes and Rating Analysis" chart shows significant year-over-year fluctuations in both votes and ratings. Closely tracking these trends can help identify which factors (e.g., genre, director, release timing) contribute to successful movie performance.

5. Analyze the impact of movie certification: The "Movie Distribution by Certification" and "Movie Count and Cost Count by Certificate" charts suggest that movie certification (e.g., G, PG, R) may influence audience appeal and profitability. Considering certification requirements and their impact on your target audience could be important.
   
6. Identify and address the shift in movie-going preferences: The "Year Wise Trend in Top Movies" chart indicates a potential shift in audience preferences, with certain genres (e.g., Adventure/Comedy/Drama) gaining popularity over time. Adapting your project to align with these evolving preferences could improve its chances of success.

7. Study the Golden Age success factors: The candlestick chart reveals that movies from the 1960s-1970s achieved peak ratings (8.6-9.2), suggesting the importance of studying this era's filmmaking approaches and potentially adapting successful elements to modern productions.

8. Balance risk and consistency: The lower volatility but slightly lower ratings in recent decades (8.0-8.2) indicate a more conservative approach to filmmaking. Consider finding a sweet spot between creative risk-taking and maintaining consistent quality.
   
9. Adapt to modern audience expectations: The candlestick analysis shows that contemporary audiences might be more critical in their ratings. Focus on understanding and meeting current audience expectations while maintaining artistic integrity.
    
10. Implement quality benchmarking: Use the historical high ratings from the golden age as benchmarks for excellence, while acknowledging that modern success metrics may need adjustment for today's more saturated market environment.
    
11. Consider period-specific strengths: The candlestick patterns show that different eras had distinct characteristics in terms of rating performance. Analyze what worked best in each period and how those elements might be relevant to contemporary filmmaking.
    
12. Develop risk management strategies: The varying volatility shown in the candlestick chart suggests the need for balanced approaches to creative risk-taking, especially in modern productions where rating stability appears to be more common.
